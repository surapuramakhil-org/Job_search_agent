### Download and Install Python

Ensure you have the latest Python version installed (Python 3.11 or higher is required for this project). If not, download and install it from Python's official website. For detailed instructions, refer to the tutorials:
- [How to Install Python on Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html)
- [How to Install Python on Linux](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html)
- [How to Download and Install Python on macOS](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html)

### Download and Install Google Chrome

Download and install the latest version of Google Chrome in its default location from the [official website](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

### Install Poetry

Follow the instructions provided on Poetry's [official installation page](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/surapuramakhil-org/Job_hunt_assistant.git
cd Job_hunt_assistant
```

#### switching to stable versions

place to find release tags: https://github.com/surapuramakhil-org/Job_search_assistant/releases

```bash
git checkout <tag_name>
```

example:
```bash
git checkout v0.1.0-beta
```

### Setting Up the Project with Poetry

Since the project already includes a `pyproject.toml` file, follow these steps:

#### Install Dependencies

Run the following command in the project directory to install all dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
poetry install
```

### Create `.env` File

To configure environment variables for the project, create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.template` file provided in the repository. This file will store sensitive information such as API keys and other configuration settings.

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

After copying, open the `.env` file and fill in the required values. Ensure you do not share this file or commit it to version control, as it contains sensitive information.

### Usage 

0. **Account language**
   To ensure the bot works, your account language must be set to English.

1. **Data Folder:**
   Ensure that your data_folder contains the following files:
      - `secrets.yaml`
      - `work_preferences.yaml`
      - `plain_text_resume.yaml`

   Also, make sure you fill all placeholders. This is important!.

### For configuration refer [this docs](/docs/configuration.md)

2. **Output Folder:**
    Contains the output of the bot.
    - `data.json` results of the --collect mode
    - `failed.json` failed applications
    - `open_ai_calls.json` all the calls made to the LLM model
    - `skipped.json` applications that were skipped
    - `success.json` successful applications

    **Note:** `answers.json` is not part of the output folder and can be found in the root of the project. It is used to store the answers of the questions asked to the user. Can be used to update the bot with corrected answers. Search for `Select an option`, `0`, `Authorized`, and `how many years of` to verify correct answers.

3. **Run the Bot:**

   job search assistant offers flexibility in how it handles your pdf resume:

- **Dynamic Resume Generation:**
  If you don't use the `--resume` option, the bot will automatically generate a unique resume for each application. This feature uses the information from your `plain_text_resume.yaml` file and tailors it to each specific job application, potentially increasing your chances of success by customizing your resume for each position.

   ```bash
   poetry run python src/main.py
   ```

- **Using a Specific Resume:**
  If you want to use a specific PDF resume for all applications, place your resume PDF in the `data_folder` directory and run the bot with the `--resume` option:

  ```bash
  poetry run python src/main.py --resume /path/to/your/resume.pdf
  ```

- **Using the collect mode:**
  If you want to collect job data only to perform any type of data analytics you can use the bot with the `--collect` option. This will store in output/data.json file all data found,

  ```bash
  poetry run python src/main.py --collect
  ```
